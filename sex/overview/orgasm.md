# Orgasm

Orgasm is the peak of sexual pleasure that is experienced during sexual activity. It is a complex and highly individualized experience that can vary greatly from person to person. In recent years, research has demonstrated that orgasm can have numerous benefits for physical, mental, and emotional health. These benefits can include improved mood, reduced stress, and enhanced immune function, among others.

According to a review of the literature published in the journal American Journal of Public Health, orgasm is a natural and healthy part of human sexuality. It is a physiological response that is triggered by sexual arousal and can result in a variety of physical and psychological changes. In addition, orgasm can be a powerful tool for health and wellness, and can be used to support a variety of health conditions.

Here are some of the main health benefits of orgasm, as supported by research:

* Reduces stress and anxiety: Orgasm involves the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that can have a calming and relaxing effect on the body. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology found that regular orgasm can reduce stress and anxiety, leading to improved mental and emotional health. In addition, orgasm can support stress reduction and can be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals with anxiety and other mental health conditions. (Author: Brody, S., et al.
